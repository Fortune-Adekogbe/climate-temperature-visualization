# climate-temperature-visualization
A visualization of the climate temperature using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

The goal here was to demonstrate how Streamlit can be used with InfluxDB to
build dashboards that visualize time series data. The data used here was Air Temperature information from
the [weather data](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/) recorded at the [Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/index.php/Main/HomePage?userlang=en).

Here is the [live dashboard](https://fortune-adekogbe-climate-temperature-visualization-app-l-ubvjy0.streamlitapp.com/).
